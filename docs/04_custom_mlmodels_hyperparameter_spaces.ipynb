Custom hyperparameter search\n\nIn `datasciencefunctions` models are trained using a validation option of choice with two possible hyperparameter space search techniques:\n* hyperopt\n* param_grid\n\n#### Hyperopt\n`hyperopt` is a Python package for framework-agnostic hyperparameter optimization and so can be used with models from e.g. scikit-learn and PySpark. It uses a stochastic technique with similarites to gradient descent (and also markov chain monte carlo methods) to search the parameter space. During the search it explores the given hyperparameter space and in each iteration tries to move to the parts of the space with the highest chance of improving a given loss function (in our case it's the value `-metric` where we try to maximize `metric`). Several advantages of `hyperopt` include:\n * No need to provide specific values for numeric parameters (just define the distribution).\n * `param_grid` only tries specific points in the space and can therefore miss \n * Usually finds better solution than `param_grid` if given the same number of combinations to try.\n * Easier control over computation time needed (simply specify `max_evals` instead of calculating number points in param grid).\nHowever, since the method is stochastic by nature, it might produce different results each time when using a low number of iterations in a large hyperparameter space. \n\n#### Hyperparameter grid\nThe `param_grid` option is the classical way of searching the hyperparameter space - the user gives a set of possible hyperparameter values as an input, all combinations of hyperparameters from the grid are tried and the one with the best loss function on the test set is then selected. The advantage of `param_grid` is the fact that it is deterministic and will explore all combinations of possible hyperparameters given by the user. However, it is not suitable for large hyperparameter spaces with broad ranges and large numbers of hyperparameters since it is computationally heavy. Unlike `hyperopt` it also requires the user to specify all possible options for each hyperparameter by hand."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"a6f0427e-cf7e-448e-8dc6-1f1b18e9619c"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Custom searches with hyperopt\n\nLet us first see how we can specify a custom hyperparameter for our model space when using the hyperopt technique.

You can read [how to define hyperopt spaces here (a part of hyperopt documentation)](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt/wiki/FMin#21-parameter-expressions).\n\nIn the example above (which is the default hyperopt search space for the `ds.MlModel.spark_random_forest_classifier` model) we say that we want to search a paramater space for the maximum depth of the tree from 2 to 50 and take into considerations all values between. Similarly for the number of estimators (i.e. the number of trees).\n\nUnlike in param_grid, hyperopt allows you to define the search space for a hyperparameter as an interval and even allows you to skew the possible values to one side (making them more likely to be tried).\n\nFor instance in `ds.MlModel.spark_GLM_binomial` we could specify the search space for the regularization parameter as \n\n```\"regParam\": hp.uniform(\"regParam\", 0.0, 1.0)```\n\nwhich would tell hyperopt to search the entire interval from 0 to 1 uniformly or for example\n\n`\"regParam\": hp.loguniform(\"regParam\",
