It allows beginner users to train models in a correct way quickly and it allows experienced users to skip a lot of repetitive code when dealing with standard modelling tasks. Ultimately the `do_datasciencing` is a model training pipeline wrapped up in a single function - with it, the user can train a model (with cross-validation based hyperparameter selection), get the model summary containing most important information about the model and (optionally) log the model and the summary to MLFlow.\n\nIn a later tutorial, we will se how to unwrap do_datasciencing to use its components mentioned above in a modular and customized fashion when the standard approach is not enough."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"b52d3f41-0c69-46b0-8bf6-545f9912ad25"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We will now import `datasciencefunctions` as `ds` and in the rest of this tutorial we will sometimes refer to `datasciencefunctions` as `ds` when discussing the modules of the package and their functions"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"12c37d17-652c-4f0a-bcc4-35e587f448fb"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import datasciencefunctions as ds\nimport datasciencefunctions.classification as dsclass"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"c6322a68-0caf-47f2-8003-d2b0b6204fce"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#0.
